# Static RSS reader

This tool periodically fetches entries from a [list of RSS feeds](feeds.txt), renders them into html and deploys with GitHub pages.
You can see the resulting page at https://caksoylar.github.io/static-rss/.

Inspired by https://matklad.github.io/2025/06/26/rssssr.html, written in Python with feedparser to work with feeds and mako to render html.
